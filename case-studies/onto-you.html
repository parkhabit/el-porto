<h2 class='title'>Glossary of Design Definitions</h2>
<p class='body-text'>
    When I first started researching and learning about design I felt like I was learning a new design term everyday. It was hard to keep up with what each one meant and why they were important. So I’ve put together a quick guide of some of the most common or important terms in order to have something to refer back to.

<h5>UX design & UI design</h5>
<p class='body-text'>
    To sum up very quickly user experience (UX) design is based more on the experience, it’s about improving the interaction between a user and the product. It’s not specifically about the visuals, but how people interact with and experience the product as a whole. This could be looking at the flow of how the user experiences a website, or how a certain page might overload the user because of too much information.
    User interface (UI) design is a digital type of designing, it’s more focused on the visual look, feel, and interaction with the product. They will think about things like, but not limited to icons, typography, spacing, and imagery.

<h5>Experience Design</h5>

        Designing an experience - the clock that lights up as you wake up in the morning, the idea of the clock that tells the time by releasing different smells at different times during the day
        Opposed to designing a product to have a good user experience, this is where the end product is the experience. For example the IPhone it’s a beautiful aesthetically pleasing phone. But the experience of a phone call is not designed, that is up to the user and what apps they download. The material product is designed.
